This GitHub repo contains materials for the graduate course in Plant Genomics at Michigan State University. 

This course will cover the principles, concepts, and applications of genomic science in plant biology. Broad topics include genome sequencing, comparative genomics, gene expression analysis, epigenomics, pangenomics, and single-cell biology, along with techniques for surveying genetic variation and quantitative genetics. Genomics has been continually evolving over the last two decades, and we will discuss the history, triumphs, and mistakes as well as the emerging frontiers and ongoing challenges within the field. The course will involve lectures, paper discussions, and lab activities. There will also be general discussions on topics related to publishing, grant funding, data reproducibility, and ethics in biology. Each major topic will be accompanied by a lab activity where students will utilize publicly available bioinformatic resources via the MSU high performance computing infrastructure to analyze genomic data. These Jupyter notebooks will often contain advanced techniques and instructions beyond the scope of this course that can serve as valuable resources for your own research in the future. 

Course goals:

The course will synthesize concepts from computational and genome sciences with plant biology principles.
The goals for this course are for students to:

(1) acquire foundational knowledge and skill sets in plant biology and data science. 

(2) formulate hypothesis-driven questions stemming from grand challenges at the interface of plant genomics and data sciences

(3) Synthesize acquired skills to collaboratively solve complex questions. 

(4) communicate persuasively across disciplines and cultures with peers and the public

By the end of the course, students will be able to identify and create strategies to address current
problems in plant biology using cutting edge computational tools and genomic approaches. Through interactive lectures and applied labs, students will learn to communicate across disciplines to explore emergent biological processes.
